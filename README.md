- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndrewRossall
- 👀 I'm a physicist with 10 years postdoc experience with a passion for code and analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning (kinda meta).
- 💞️ I’m looking to move away from academia so I'm working to improve my computational skillset (and unlearn a few bad habits).
